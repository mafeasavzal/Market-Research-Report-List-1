<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains & Wound Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical drains and wound drainage systems are essential medical tools for managing post-operative fluid accumulation. The market consists of two primary types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity or capillary action to facilitate fluid removal, often using simple devices like Penrose drains. In contrast, active drains employ suction to create negative pressure, enhancing fluid evacuation, commonly seen in closed systems such as Jackson-Pratt or Hemovac drains. Both types play crucial roles in promoting healing and preventing complications.</p></p>
