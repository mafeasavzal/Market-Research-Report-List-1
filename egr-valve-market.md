<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EGR Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electronically Controlled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EGR valve market is segmented into two main types: mechanical and electronically controlled. Mechanical EGR valves use a simple spring and diaphragm mechanism to open and close, relying on engine vacuum for operation, making them cost-effective but less precise. In contrast, electronically controlled EGR valves utilize sensors and electronic control units for more precise regulation of exhaust gas recirculation, improving engine performance and emissions control. This technological difference drives distinct market demand and applications in the automotive industry.</p></p>
