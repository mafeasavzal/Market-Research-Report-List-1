<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Methane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fermentation</li><li>Gasification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The methane market consists of two primary types: fermentation and gasification. Fermentation involves the anaerobic breakdown of organic materials by microorganisms, producing biogas primarily composed of methane, which can be harnessed for energy. Gasification, on the other hand, is a thermochemical process that converts carbon-rich materials, such as biomass or fossil fuels, into synthesis gas, including methane, through high-temperature reactions with limited oxygen. Both processes contribute to methane production but utilize different feedstocks and technologies.</p></p>
